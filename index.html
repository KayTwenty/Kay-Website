        Hello! I'm a developer, but I do all sorts of stuff.
        I mainly write Python and JavaScript, but I like to
        look around and experiment with new things, especially
        programming languages. I enjoy creating things as I
        come up with an idea for something neat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spend most of my time creating things that I find
        fun and interesting (it's so fun being unemployed)!
        The source code to my (undeleted) projects are on
        GitHub. Open source is cool!
      </p>
      <p>
        My main projects are usually Discord bots, 
        I've built & tested a ton of them and currently 
        am running two atm. You can check them out by 
        clicking on top of the page!
